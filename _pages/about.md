Hello fren, if you've made it this far then you must have been really desperate to get an answer for something that may have popped up on a search engine! 

I created this website to initially serve as a landing page for my domain verified Damus account but I've decided to document my progress in learning primarily about NOSTR and to share my knowledge and experiences with others who are also interested. I can't even predict what these topics will be on but it's a platform to host for the rest of history, let's hope I won't be judged harshly.

My journey into NOSTR began when one day I seen a random string beginning with npub and a lot of noise around it - decided to look it up and subsequently give it a go. One thing is for sure, NOSTR not for normies out of the box so I plan to document my journey through it.

For now you can catch me on [NOSTR](https://snort.social/p/npub1pdar6skecgv8dysvct7ehmzleuhlhr5d9ef4wrrmhwy4t4uhdehqt8mcg7)
